# EngineerTaskManagement📝

## Project Description:
EngineerTaskManagement is a **C#-based system** designed for efficient task and engineer management.  
It allows managers to create tasks, set dependencies, assign tasks based on skill levels, and generate schedules. Engineers can log in, view available tasks, and claim them based on their skill levels and availability.

### Key Features:

#### For Managers:
- 📝 **Task Management**: Create tasks with defined levels, dependencies, and other attributes.
- 👥 **Engineer Management**: Add and manage engineers with specific levels and expertise.
- 📅 **Schedule Generation**: Automatically create a task schedule considering dependencies and start times.
- 🛠️ **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to engineers based on the engineer’s skill level.

#### For Engineers:
-  **Task Selection**: Engineers log in to claim tasks suitable for their level.

## Using the Application:

### For Managers:
-  **Task Management**: Create tasks by setting parameters such as difficulty level, task dependencies, and estimated completion times.
-  **Engineer Management**: Add engineers with different skill levels and areas of expertise, and assign them to appropriate tasks.
-  **Schedule Generation**: The system will automatically generate a task schedule, considering task dependencies and engineers' availability.
-  **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to engineers based on their skill level and availability.

### For Engineers:
- 🧑‍💻 **Task Selection**: Engineers log in to the system and see a list of available tasks. They can claim tasks based on their skill level and availability.
- 🔄 **Task Progress**: Engineers can update the status of tasks they are working on (e.g., in-progress, completed).
